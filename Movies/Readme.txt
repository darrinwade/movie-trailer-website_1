The checked in Movies.zip file contains a directory structure, Movies,
    which in turn contains the following:

(1) fresh_tomatoes.html - HTML file that is used to access a web page containing movie posters
    showing 9 of my favorite movies, (hope you like them too), along with their associated video
    clips.

(2) media and fresh_tomatoes compiled Python classes - Compiled classes used via the HTML to 
    render content
.
(3) entertainment_center.py fresh_tomatoes.py media.py - Python scripts created to facilitate
    the "Movie Trailer"
    functionality.  They can be used in the creation of a similar website.
    



In order to access the "Movie Trailer" app, unzip the Movies.zip file onto a server directory 
structure and double click 
the fresh_tomatoes HTML file. The "Movie Trailer" page will display
 and provide images along with a small movie clip of 
9 of my favorite movies.
